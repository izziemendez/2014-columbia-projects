<strong>Nicholas Heyward</strong> lost his first son in 1994 when police officers mistook the 13-year-old's toy gun for a real one. It is during the two years of his duty as NYC police commissioner that Heyward says Bratton failed to hold the <acronym title="New York City Police Department">NYPD</acronym> accountable for officer involved shootings of civilians. <br><br>

"Under Bratton, there were over 30 unarmed people that were killed," says Heyward.

The group, known informally as New Yorkers Against Bill Bratton, wants Commissioner Bratton removed from the position for a few reasons: 


<ul>
<li>Bratton was the first to enforce the police strategy now known as "Stop and Frisk." </li>
	<li>Protestors argue that Bratton's introduction of 9mm handguns increased officer involved incidents.</li>
	<li>Citing a report by Amnesty International, the group says Bratton's years as commissioner brought about an increase in complaints of police brutality by 37%.</li>
